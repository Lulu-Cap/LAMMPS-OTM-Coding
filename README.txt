This directory is for the modification of LAMMPS to run the USER-OTM package

There are three main subdirectories:
1. Core Source: Contains all the core LAMMPS source files (package independent) that need to be modified including an adjusted makefile. Also contains a lib folder, whose contents must be inserted in the LAMMPS lib folder before use (follow README instructions w/in).
2. USER-OTM: Contains OTM specific files 
3. Documentation: Contains documentation on how to make and use the OTM package
